# Intro to git  PED Day 2017

## What is this?

These are hands on git tutorials, using git installed locally, and [github.com](http://github.com) a remote
repository server.

## What is a git repository?

A git repository is a directory structure similar to that which you see on any computer.

## What is git?

git is a client server distributed version control system.  It allows for backup and collaboration  with others in the modification of _plain-text_ files.


You can track any kind of file in a git repository (images, etc.), but it's best suited for
_plain-text_ files like software source code.

## How do I use git?

These tutorials use git commands to create and update a local and a remote repository.

## Tutorial Exercises, Let's get started!

In the first lab, you'll create a repository on your computer and use it to learn some git
commands. Then you'll also publish your repository to a remote server like github.com.

### [Using git solo](01_basics_stripped.md)

In the second lab you will work with a partner to get a
glimpse of how git is used for collaboration.
