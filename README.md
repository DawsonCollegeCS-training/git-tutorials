# Intro to git



## What is this?

These are hands on git tutorials, using git installed locally, and [github.com](http://github.com) a remote
repository server.

## What is a git repository?

A git repository is a directory structure similar to that which you see on any computer.

## What is git?

git is a client server distributed version control system.  It allows for backup and collaboration  with others in the modification of _plain-text_ files.


You can track any kind of file in a git repository (images, etc.), but it's best suited for
_plain-text_ files like software source code.

## How do I use git?

Prequisite: it helps to have a tiny bit of experience with [command-line
tools](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php). You can try the [free interactive bash
tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

We assume you have git installed. If not, you can download it here: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

These tutorials use git commands to create and update a local and a remote repository. We assume
you are using `git-bash` on Windows or the default terminal on Mac OS and Linux.

## Let's get started!

### Presentation Slide Deck

<https://gitpitch.com/DawsonCollegeCS-training/ped-day-2017/ped-day-2017#/>

### Using git solo

*   [Tutorial 1](01_basics_stripped.md)

    *   In the first tutorial exercise, you'll create a repository on your computer and use it to   
        learn some git
        commands. Then you'll also publish your repository to a remote server like github.com.

### Using git to collaborate

*   [Tutorial 2](02_branches_stripped.md)

    *   In the second tutorial exercise, you will work with a partner to get a
        glimpse of how git is used for collaboration.


## More details, more tutorials, course materials

The set of tutorials above is a stripped down version of a couple of the tutorials we assign to our students.
If you want to redo with text explanations & instructions or continue with more advanced information you can look at the other files in this repository, or here is a small
[menu of the main student tutorials](MENU_student_tutorials.md)

It also contains a write up of the concept of the protected branch workflow.

Thank you for listening to us, we hope you enjoyed the workshop.
Please feel free to contact us if
you have questions (or corrections) about the tutorials or our use of git.
