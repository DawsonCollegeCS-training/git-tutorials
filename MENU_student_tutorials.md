# Material given to students

There are more detailed instructions and explanations in the following tutorials than those we used in the workshop, but the actions are the same.

This is mostly a menu but just a note that if you want to get started with markdown _but_ you have a lot of existing  material  [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is an excellent tool to convert between formats.
