# git and ssh keys

## What is this?
If you're reading this text in a web browser, you're probably at the URL for a GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket/... project page. (From now on, we'll write GitBlarg to mean any one of GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket/...). This tutorial is stored in a git repository hosted on gitblarg.com, and gitblarg.com provides a web-based user interface for viewing the content of the repository, which is what you're looking at right now.

If you are not familiar with git please see the [first tutorial](../01_basics.md) in this series.  This tutorial will show you how to upload your SSH key to a repository server.

## What is SSH
SSH (secure shell) is  one of the methods used to remotely access *nix computers and it is one of the options available from  most
repository hosts to provide encryption.

Symmetric key are used by SSH in order to encrypt the entire connection. The public/private key pairs that are generated by you are used
for authentication (not encryption) The idea behind a public/private key encryption is that anyone with the public key can encrypt data
which can then ONLY be read by the person with the private key. So that is used for authentication.
The key that is used to encrypt is created through an exchange between the client and server.  Both contribute to the creation of the
unique secret key for the session.

## Instructions
Before we proceed you must have an ssh key on your local host, to generate a key see the [instructions here](keygen.md)  Once you have a key or if you previously generated a key, read on.

When you generated your key ssh-keygen created a directory structure as follows

Note: this will be in /h on the lab computers, it will be elsewhere on your home computer.

``` {.bash}
$ ls -l .ssh/
total 9
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197121 1679 Nov 29  2016 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197121  403 Nov 29  2016 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197121 1163 Aug 11 17:04 known_hosts
```

Never share your private key (id_rsa) you need to copy the content of your public key into the clipboard as follows in git-bash:

``` {.bash}
# copy your public key to the clipboard
cat ./ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
```

Logon to your git repo server (github/gitlab etc) and follow the appropriate instructions
